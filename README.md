# Pacman in MASM x86 with GUI

A classic Pacman game implemented in x86 Assembly (MASM) with a graphical user interface using Irvine Library. This project demonstrates how low-level programming can be used to create interactive graphical games.

## Features

- Classic Pacman gameplay
- Implemented entirely in x86 Assembly using MASM
- Custom graphical user interface for smooth gameplay
- Score tracking
- Multiple levels (if implemented)
- Sound effects (if implemented)

## How It Works

The game logic, graphics, and input handling are all implemented in Assembly. The GUI uses Windows API calls to render the game board and handle user input (keyboard/mouse).
